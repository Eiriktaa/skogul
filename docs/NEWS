v0.3.1.alpha1
=============

Test of new automated release-notes logic.

v0.3.0
======

Release date: 2019-11-18

Skogul 0.3.0 contains several changes aimed at project management, some to
improve core functionality, and some module improvements. It's not a huge
change since 0.2.0, and that's how we like it. As per usual, we aim for
high quality releases.

Specific changes:

- Use of CI and automated building of release tar-balls
- Cleanup and refresh of documentation
- There's now a single unified way of handling modules that dramatically
  reduces code duplication in core.
- Modules can now provide documentation for nested data structures, which
  is correctly exposed in manual pages.
- A conditional transformer (#71) was added that provides a mechanism to
  only execute a transformer if certain conditions are present.
- The "extract" feature of the metadata transformer no longer creates empty
  metadata keys, and will remove the original to avoid duplicating
  information.
- The logrus receiver replaces the log-receiver, allowing better control of
  log data. More work in this area is to be expected.
- The HTTP receiver can now apply different authorization rules for
  different paths.

The latter constitutes a bit of a change in configuration.
