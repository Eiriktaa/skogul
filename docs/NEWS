v0.5.0
======

Unreleased

v0.4.1
======

Release date: 2020-01-06

Skogul 0.4.1 brings support for exposing MQTT topics in the metadata. Yup, that's it.

v0.4.0
======

Release date: 2019-12-04

Skogul 0.4.0 brings MQTT configuration up to speed with other receivers and senders.
A new transformer to set the timestamp is introduced, as well as a custom JSON parser
for use where the incoming JSON format does not conform to the one of Skogul.
Furthermore, new versions now ship with prebuilt RPMs as well as prebuilt archives.
We also run automated tests on all example configuration in ./docs/examples!

Specific changes:

- JSON syntax errors offsets correctly with tabs
- Support building RPMs and build RPMs for new releases
- Bring MQTT configuration up to speed (configuration updates required!)
- MQTT wildcard support (+ and #)
- A custom JSON parser, for use when the JSON is not already on Skogul format
- Timestamp transformer, used to set the timestamp of a metric from data

v0.3.0
======

Release date: 2019-11-18

Skogul 0.3.0 contains several changes aimed at project management, some to
improve core functionality, and some module improvements. It's not a huge
change since 0.2.0, and that's how we like it. As per usual, we aim for
high quality releases.

Specific changes:

- Use of CI and automated building of release tar-balls
- Cleanup and refresh of documentation
- There's now a single unified way of handling modules that dramatically
  reduces code duplication in core.
- Modules can now provide documentation for nested data structures, which
  is correctly exposed in manual pages.
- A conditional transformer (#71) was added that provides a mechanism to
  only execute a transformer if certain conditions are present.
- The "extract" feature of the metadata transformer no longer creates empty
  metadata keys, and will remove the original to avoid duplicating
  information.
- The logrus receiver replaces the log-receiver, allowing better control of
  log data. More work in this area is to be expected.
- The HTTP receiver can now apply different authorization rules for
  different paths.

The latter constitutes a bit of a change in configuration.
