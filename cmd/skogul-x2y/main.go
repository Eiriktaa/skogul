/*
Skogul is primarily a framework, where you use it to build your OWN
binaries. This package is provided to satisfy the common deployment
of using Skogul as a simple gateway from X to Y - it only utilizes a
small subset of the possible senders and receivers provided by Skogul,
but should prove sufficient for many scenarios.

skogul-x2y will allow you to accept metrics from a single data source and
forward it to an other. Since Skogul will parse the input data into an
internal format, any "receiver" can be forwarded to any "sender", as long
as said receiver and sender participate in the Auto-framework that allows
semi-automatic configuration.

It also doesn't necessarily offer the full capabilities of the relevant
senders and receivers, but authors of senders and receivers are encouraged
to make it possible to expose as many features as possible in this fashion,
through the senders.Auto and receivers.Auto mechanisms.

For a demonstration of more complex features, see pkg/cmd/skogul-demo, which
tries to demonstrate how to chain multiple senders and set up a more
complex receiver, for the sake of demonstration.

What you are mainly missing with this package is advanced error-handling,
load balancing, graceful failure, etc.
