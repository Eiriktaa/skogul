skogul-demo tries to showcase the Skogul frameworks more advanced
functions. Since Skogul is primarily a framework used to build custom
pipelines for metrics, you need to actually write your own binaries
using the framework to build more complex chains. The most common
and trivial use cases are covered by cmd/skogul-x2y, but skogul-demo
tries to show a more complex example.

While it is usually possible to write it "the right way up" - start with
where we receive data and add senders - it's easier to write it "up-side-down"
and start with the final resting place for data. So you might consider reading
this bottom-up if it looks weird.

We are going to set up a chain of senders, starting with HTTP receiver which has
three distinct paths and handlers/chains: / sends to the primary handler,
/debug sends to a debug handler that just echos the parsed JSON to log.Print, and
/debug/notemplate does the same, but does not expand any provided template.

The primary chain looks sort of like this:

	http -> fallback -> delay -> counter ->  dupe2 -> postgres
	            \                    \             `-> influx
	             \			 `------------/
		      \
		       `- dupe --> Log(print "the following failed")
		               `-> debug(print json to stdout)

	countHandler := skogul.Handler{
		Sender:       influx,
		Transformers: []skogul.Transformer{}}

	// The counter generates statistics for us every Period time
	// (assuming data) and sends it to the Stats-handler (here:
	// influx). While it might seem strange to have a handler instead
	// of just a Sender at first, this allows us to provide arbitrary
	// transformers to the stats, e.g.: add metadata.
	counter := &sender.Counter{Next: dupe2, Stats: countHandler, Period: 1 * time.Second}

	// Let's also inject a random delay for testing!
	delay := sender.Sleeper{Next: counter, MaxDelay: 5000 * time.Millisecond, Verbose: false}

	fanout := sender.Fanout{Next: &delay}

	// Let's detach
	detach := sender.Detacher{Next: &fanout}

	// An other duplicator. This one just prints "The following failed"
	// and then uses the Debug-sender to print the metrics.
	dupe := sender.Dupe{Next: []skogul.Sender{sender.Log{Message: "The following failed"}, sender.Debug{}}}

	// the Fallback sender tries to write to the delay-sender
	// (delay->counter->dupe2->{postgres,influx}), but if this
	// fails, it will write to the dupe-sender (print "the following
	// failed" and the request).
	fb := sender.Fallback{}
	fb.Add(&detach)
	fb.Add(&dupe)

	// That takes care of the sender-chains. Let's set up three
	// receiver handlers.

	// This is the "normal" one - send to the fallback sender and
	// that's it. It also has a single transformer that - prior to
	// sending the data on - expands any template provided.
	h := skogul.Handler{
		Parser:       parser.JSON{},

		Parser:       parser.JSON{},
		Sender:       sender.Debug{},
		Transformers: []skogul.Transformer{transformer.Templater{}}}

	// Print the request, but do NOT expand the template. Demonstrates
	// what a template does and what the template transformer does.
	debugnotemplate := skogul.Handler{
		Parser:       parser.JSON{},
		Sender:       sender.Debug{},
		Transformers: []skogul.Transformer{}}

	// Set up a HTTP receiver
	rcvr := receiver.HTTP{Address: "[::1]:8080"}

	// Add the various handlers to relevant paths.
	rcvr.Handle("/", &h)
	rcvr.Handle("/debug", &debugtemplate)
	rcvr.Handle("/debug/notemplate", &debugnotemplate)
