/*
Enrich transformer adds additional metadatainformation to metrics. This
is a work in progress, see #224 for on-going discussions.

Some items that need to be resolved:
- Need benchmarks
- This hash thing is just weird, maybe just use sha512 instead.
- I think we _have_ to stringify. A weird example is that float 0 and
  int 0 is binary equivalent, which means that if the source is parsed as
  float and the metric as int, most numbers wont match, but 0 will, which
  is just confusing.
- I don't like the buffer thing at all, but it might be needed I suppose.
  Need to double check how performant that is for the typical scenario, and
  possibly make it configurable.
- Need to warn if the source has more metadata fields than we care about, and fail if has fewer.
- Need to be able to reload, preferably in the background.
- We might need to add a Init interface here to give the transformer a
  chance to load before we start accepting data. All once.Do() works OK for
  things that are fast, but this could possibly be hundreds of megabytes of
  JSON that needs to be read and parsed and hashed.
- Yeah, benchmarks.
