/*
These senders are somewhat controversial, as they affect the fanout/fan-in
behavior of Skogul. If you use detacher on a receiver that already does multiple
go routines, you end up with fan-in. You could couple it with the Fanout sender
to go back to multiple go routines, but yeah.... this is not without its drawbacks.

However, they ARE useful, just make sure you think through side effects of using
these senders.
*/

/*
Detacher accepts a message, sends it to a channel, then picks it up on the
other end in a separate go routine. This, unfortunately, leads to fan-in:
if used in conjunction with HTTP receiver, for example, you end up going from
multiple independent go routines to a single one, which is probably not what
you want.

The purpose is to smooth out reading.

/*
Fanout sender implements a worker pool for passing data on. This SHOULD be
unnecessary, as the receiver should ideally do this for us (e.g.: the
HTTP receiver does this natively). However, there might be times
where it makes sense, specially since this can be used in reverse too:
you can use the Fanout sender to limit the degree of concurrency that
downstream is exposed to.

Again, this should really not be needed. If you use the fanout sender, be
sure you understand why.

There only settings provided is "Next" to provide the next sender, and
"Workers", that defines the size of the worker pool.
