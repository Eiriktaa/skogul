/*
Skogul is primarily a framework, where you use it to build your OWN
binaries. This package is provided to satisfy the common deployment
of using Skogul as a simple gateway from X to Y - it only utilizes a
small subset of the possible senders and receivers provided by Skogul,
but should prove sufficient for many scenarios.

It also doesn't necessarily offer the full capabilities of the relevant
senders and receivers, but authors of senders and receivers are encouraged
to make it possible to expose as many features as possible in this fashion,
through the senders.Auto and receivers.Auto mechanisms.

What you are mainly missing with this package is advanced error-handling,
load balancing, graceful failure, etc.
