/*
Skogul is primarily a framework, where you use it to build your OWN
binaries. This package is provided to satisfy the common deployment
of using Skogul as a simple gateway from X to Y - it only utilizes a
small subset of the possible senders and receivers provided by Skogul,
but should prove sufficient for many scenarios.

XXX: Future work on Senders and Receivers will include a convention/method
of automating this process. Quite possibly by providing a FromURL(url)
function which will (attempt to) generate the appropriate Sender
or Receiver based on URL.
