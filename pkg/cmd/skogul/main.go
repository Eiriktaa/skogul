/*
Please be aware: This is NOT inteded to be "The final perfect version"
of how to run Skogul.

Skogul is primarily a framework, where you use it to build your OWN
binaries.

This is meant more to show-case existing features. Right now it's merely
a "This is where I test everything" thing.

In the future, a few more examples will be provided in separate files.

It kinda reads a bit up-side down, starting with the final resting place
for data so to speak, then ending with starting a web server to receive
data.

	// Everything going to the duplicator will go to both influx and
	// postgres.
	dupe2 := senders.Dupe{Next: []skogul.Sender{influx, postgres}}

	// The counter generates statistics for us every Period time
	// (assuming data) and sends it to the Stats-sender (here: influx)
	counter := &senders.Counter{Next: dupe2, Stats: influx, Period: 1 * time.Second}

	// Let's also inject a random delay for testing
	delay := &senders.Sleeper{counter, 1 * time.Millisecond, false}
