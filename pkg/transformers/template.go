/*
The template transformer is responsbile for consuming the template of a
container and copying it to the individual metrics.

Note that templates are SHALLOW. If you have a template that goes

"metadata": { "foo": { "key1": "value1" }

then a metric provides

"metadata": { "foo": { "key2": "value2" } }

then the "foo.key1" will NOT be part of the end result, as the template logic
only sees that the metric has a "foo" object, and thus does not try to do
further templating of that key.

Implementation-wise, this isn't really perfect - ideally it should be done
on read, but because this provides a degree of flexibility that is hard to
achieve with a getter, this seems like a reasonable compromise.
