 * The Container is the top-level object that simply contains a collection
 * of metrics.
 *
 * It contains an optional template, and an array of metrics. The idea is
 * that a producer of metrics sends a bulk of metrics in a single request,
 * and we deal with it. To provide flexibility, the producer can provide an
 * (optional) template, which will be the starting point of individual
 * metrics. Example use-cases of the template include providing a timestamp
 * if all the metrics provided are from the same time stamp, and metadata
 * keys that are common, such as origin-server perhaps.

 * A metric is a single set of measurements and related timestamp and

 *
 * The difference between Data and Metadata is that the metadata is used to
 * identify the data, along with the timestamp. In database-terms, the
 * indexed parts are timestamp and metadata. Examples are "ifName"
 * (interface name) can be metadata, since it makes sense to search for or
 * graph data related to a single port, while "ifHCInOctets" would be data,
 * as it does NOT make sense to search for or graph data related to exactly
 * 12162 ifHCInOctets.
