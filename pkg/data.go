/*
The Container is the top-level object that simply contains a collection
of metrics.

It contains an optional template, and an array of metrics. The idea is
that a producer of metrics sends a bulk of metrics in a single request,
and we deal with it. To provide flexibility, the producer can provide an
(optional) template, which will be the starting point of individual
metrics. Example use-cases of the template include providing a timestamp
if all the metrics provided are from the same time stamp, and metadata
keys that are common, such as origin-server perhaps.

The template (should) be "expanded" by the receiver using the Template
transformer, and down-stream Senders need not worry about the template
mechanics.

/*
A metric is a single set of measurements and related timestamp and
metadata.

The difference between Data and Metadata is that the metadata is used to
identify the data, along with the timestamp. In database-terms, the
indexed parts are timestamp and metadata. Examples are "ifName"
(interface name) can be metadata, since it makes sense to search for or
graph data related to a single port, while "ifHCInOctets" would be data,
as it does NOT make sense to search for or graph data related to exactly
12162 ifHCInOctets.

Example:
	
	{
		"time": "2019-03-25T12:00:00Z",
		"metadata": {
			"device": "routera",
			"os": "JUNOS 15.4R1",
			"chassisId": "something"
		},
		"data": {
			"uptime": 124125124,
			"cputemp": 22
		}
	}

Note that multi-dimensional metrics ARE allowed, but the behavior will
depend on the storage backend. It might be wise to use a transformer
to split it into individual metrics. Example:

	{
		"time": "2019-03-25T12:00:00Z",
		"metadata": {
			"device": "routera",
			"os": "JUNOS 15.4R1",
			"chassisId": "something"
		},
		"data": {
			"ports": {
				"ge-0/0/0": {
					"ifHCInOctets":  5,
					"ifHCOutOctets": 10
				},
				"ge-0/0/1": {
					"ifHCInOctets":  2,
					"ifHCOutOctets": 20
				}
			}
		}
	}

This is legal, but it's probably wise to use a transformer to change it into:

	{
		"time": "2019-03-25T12:00:00Z",
		"metadata": {
			"device": "routera",
			"os": "JUNOS 15.4R1",
			"chassisId": "something",
			"port": "ge-0/0/0"
		},
		"data": {
			"ifHCInOctets":  5,
			"ifHCOutOctets": 10
			}
		}
	},
	{
		"time": "2019-03-25T12:00:00Z",
		"metadata": {
			"device": "routera",
			"os": "JUNOS 15.4R1",
			"chassisId": "something",
			"port": "ge-0/0/1"
		},
		"data": {
			"ifHCInOctets":  2,
			"ifHCOutOctets": 20
			}
		}
	}
