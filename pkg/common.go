/*
 * The idea is that setting up new binaries should be trivial. It may be
 * necessary to write some Go-code, but given that, the fundamental
 * distinction is that receiving data should be disconnected from storing
 * it. E.g.: We might be collecting interface statistics with a home-brew
 * SNMP collector that can post to us, and a different collector based on
 * streaming telemetry instead of SNMP, and a third source might be a
 * different security domain where they might even use the TICK-stack and
 * export to use. So we have a generic receiver-stack (so far, only HTTP),
 * a reasonably generic writer/sender stack, but the trick is to be able to
 * put this all together.
 *
 * In all likelihood, these interfaces will change over time as we add more
 * actual use cases, but the idea is the above.
 *
 * Things that WILL come in to play: What parts are concurrent and what are
 * not? Queues? What are idempotent, what are not?

 * A Sender is _seemingly_ the final step in the chain. It accepts data,

 * sender, but it can also be things such as queues (e.g.: Send() to a
 * queue which only ensures a quick accept, then sends it on to a slower
 * storage up to a threshold, after which it starts blocking or dropping,
 * depending on the queue-setup). This will allow us to do things like have
 * a queue for streaming telemetry that is lossy, while the queue for
 * SNMP-data is not.

 *
 * The key difference between a transformer and a sender is that a
 * transformer just modifies an existing collection, while a sender
 * consumes it and (optionally) produces others if further processing is
