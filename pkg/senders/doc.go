/*
Package senders is a set of types that implement skogul.Sender. A Sender in
skogul is a simple primitive that receives skogul metrics and "does
something with them".

The traditional and obvious sender accepts metrics and uses and external
service to persist them to disk. E.g.: the InfluxDB sender stores the
metrics to influxdb. The postgres sender accepts metrics and stores to
postgres, and so forth.

The other type of senders are "internal", typical for routing. The
classic examples are the "dupe" sender that accepts metrics and passes
them on to multiple other senders - e.g.: Store to both postgres and
influxdb. An other classic is the "fallback" sender: It has a list of
senders and tries each one in order until one succeeds, allowing you to
send to a primary influxdb normally - if influx fails, write to local disk,
if that fails, write a message to the log.
