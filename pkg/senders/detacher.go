XXX: The senders in detacher.go should probably be ignored for now. There are some
conceptual issues here that need to be resolved. E.g.: Should "fanout" even
exist? Should "detacher" just use "go next.Send(...)" - if so, how to avoid
exploding? etc.

/*
Detacher accepts a message, sends it to a channel, then picks it up on the
other end in a separate go routine. This, unfortunately, leades to fan-in:
if used in conjunction with HTTP receiver, for example, you end up going from
multiple independent go routines to a single one, which is probably not what
you want.

The purpose is to smooth out reading.

/*
Fanout sender implements a worker pool for passing data on. This SHOULD be
unnecessary, as the receiver should ideally do this for us (e.g.: the
HTTP receiver does this natively). However, there might be times
where it makes sense, specially since this can be used in reverse too:
you can use the Fanout sender to limit the degree of concurrency that
downstream is exposed to.

Again, this should really not be needed. If you use the fanout sender, be
sure you understand why.

There only settings provided is "Next" to provide the next sender, and
"Workers", that defines the size of the worker pool.
