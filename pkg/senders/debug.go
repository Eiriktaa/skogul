ForwardAndFail sender will pass the container to the Next sender, but
always returns an error. The use-case for this is to allow the fallback
Sender or similar to eventually send data to a sender that ALWAYS works,
e.g. the Debug-sender og just printing a message in the log, but we still
want to propagate the error upwards in the stack so clients can take
appropriate action.

Example use:

faf := senders.ForwardAndFail{Next: skogul.Debug{}}
fb := senders.Fallback{Next: []skogul.Sender{influx, faf}}
