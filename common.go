/*
Package skogul is a framework for receiving, processing and forwarding
data, typically metric data or event-oriented data, at high throughput.

It is designed to be as agnostic as possible with regards to how it
transmits data and how it receives it, and the processors in between
need not worry about how the data got there or how it will be treated in
the next chain.

This means you can use Skogul to receive data on a influxdb-like
line-based TCP interface and send it on to postgres - or influxdb -
without having to write explicit support, just set up the chain.

The guiding principles of Skogul is:

- Make as few assumptions as possible about how data is received

- Be stupid fast

In the most simple setup, you can use Skogul simply to receive data from
a random shell script and send it to influxdb. In a more complex setup,
you can have multiple Skogul servers, each in different security zones
receiving subsets of a total data set, write it to a local queue, then
transmit - through strong authentication - to two central Skogul servers
that store the data to multiple influxdb instances based on sharding
rules. Etc.

A full blown example of Skogul is provided in cmd/skogul-demo/main.go,
which is - as the file itself points out - meant as an EXAMPLE, not a final
solution.

A general-purpose command is also provided under cmd/skogul-x2y, which
provides a mechanism for starting a simplistic 1-to-1 receiver/sender chain,
and should satisfy many common use-cases. E.g.: Accepting data from MQTT
and passing it to influx. Or accepting from HTTP and printing to stdout
for debug purposes.

/*
Handler determines what a receiver will do with data received. It requires
a parser to interperet the raw data, 0 or more transformers to mutate
Containers, and a sender to call after data is parsed and mutated and ready
to be dealt with.
*/
type Handler struct {
	Parser       Parser
	Transformers []Transformer
	Sender       Sender
}

// Parser is the interface for parsing arbitrary data into a Container
type Parser interface {
	Parse(data []byte) (Container, error)
}

/*
Sender accepts data through Send() - and "sends it off". The canonical
sender is one that implements a storage backend or outgoing API. E.g.:
accept data, send to influx.

Senders are not allowed to modify the Container - there could be multiple
goroutines running with same Container. If modification is required, the
Sender needs to take a copy.

While a single sender writing to a database is useful, the true power of
the Sender-pattern is chaining multiple, tiny, senders together to build
completely custom "sender chains" and thus provide site-specific handling
of data.

E.g.: The fallback sender is set up using a list of "down stream"
senders and will accept data and try the first sender on the list,
if that fail, try the next, and so on.
*/
type Sender interface {
	Send(c *Container) error
}

/*
Transformer mutates a collection before it is passed to a sender. Transformers
should be very fast, but are the only means to modifying the data.

Currently, the only transformer is the template transformer, that expands a
template in a Container so underlying senders need not worry about the
existence of a template or not.
*/
type Transformer interface {
	Transform(c *Container) error
}

/*
Receiver is how we get data. At the point of this writing, a HTTP
receiver, line-based TCP receiver, line-based FIFO receiver, MQTT receiver
and "tester"-receiver exists. A receiver uses a Handler to deal with
data, including how to parse it. Meaning: The HTTP receiver could support
both Skogul JSON-data and other formats, and the same goes for any other
receiver.
*/
type Receiver interface {
	Start() error
}

/*
Error is a typical skogul error. All Skogul functions should provide Source
and Reason. An optional "Private" string can be provided, which, when Error()
is called, will be printed in the log, but not returned, and can thus be used
to provide "sensitive" data to the log without risk of exposing it to clients.

If the Next field is provided, error messages will recurse to the bottom, thus
propagating errors from the bottom and up.

	Private string
	Source  string
