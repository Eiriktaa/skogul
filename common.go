/*
Package skogul is a framework for receiving, processing and forwarding
data, typically metric data or event-oriented data, at high throughput.

It is designed to be as agnostic as possible with regards to how it
transmits data and how it receives it, and the processors in between
need not worry about how the data got there or how it will be treated in
the next chain.

This means you can use Skogul to receive data on a influxdb-like
line-based TCP interface and send it on to postgres - or influxdb -
without having to write explicit support, just set up the chain.

The guiding principles of Skogul is:

- Make as few assumptions as possible about how data is received

- Be stupid fast

In the most simple setup, you can use Skogul simply to receive data from
a random shell script and send it to influxdb. In a more complex setup,
you can have multiple Skogul servers, each in different security zones
receiving subsets of a total data set, write it to a local queue, then
transmit - through strong authentication - to two central Skogul servers
that store the data to multiple influxdb instances based on sharding
rules. Etc.

The cmd/skogul uses json-based configuration files to expose the relevant
internals. The json is unmarshalled directly onto the implementations, so
as long as the underlying data structure supports JSON unmarshalling, it
can be configured.

/*
Sender accepts data through Send() - and "sends it off". The canonical
sender is one that implements a storage backend or outgoing API. E.g.:
accept data, send to influx.

Senders are not allowed to modify the Container - there could be multiple
goroutines running with same Container. If modification is required, the
Sender needs to take a copy.

A sender should assume that the container has been validated, and is
non-null. Slightly counter to common sense, it is NOT recommended to
verify the input data again, since multiple senders are likely chained
and will thus likely redo the same verifications.

While a single sender writing to a database is useful, the true power of
the Sender-pattern is chaining multiple, tiny, senders together to build
completely custom "sender chains" and thus provide site-specific handling
of data.

E.g.: The fallback sender is set up using a list of "down stream"
senders and will accept data and try the first sender on the list,
if that fail, try the next, and so on.
