Handler determines what a receiver will do with data received. It requires
a parser to interperet the raw data, 0 or more transformers to mutate
Containers, and a sender to call after data is parsed and mutated and ready
to be dealt with.

Whenever a new Container is created, it should pass that to a Handler, not
directly to a Sender. This goes for artificially created data too, e.g. if
a sender wants to emit statistics. This ensures that transformers can be
used in the future.

To make it configurable, a HandlerRef should be used.

Sender accepts data through Send() - and "sends it off". The canonical
sender is one that implements a storage backend or outgoing API. E.g.:
accept data, send to influx.

Senders are not allowed to modify the Container - there could be multiple
goroutines running with same Container. If modification is required, the
Sender needs to take a copy.

A sender should assume that the container has been validated, and is
non-null. Slightly counter to common sense, it is NOT recommended to
verify the input data again, since multiple senders are likely chained
and will thus likely redo the same verifications.

Senders that pass data off to other senders should use a SenderRef instead,
to facilitate configuration.
